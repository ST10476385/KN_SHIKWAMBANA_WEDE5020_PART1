            <h2>Ruth's Story</h2>
            <div>
              <p>Born and raised in the heart of Limpopo, Ruth developed an ambitious spirit and an unwavering passion for baking that would touch countless lives. Every morning before dawn, she would rise to prepare her famous fat cakes and scones for local factories and schools.</p>
              <p>On days when school was out, I would join her in the kitchen at sunrise, watching in wonder as she measured ingredients with the precision of love, kneaded dough with patient hands, and greeted each customer like family. Ruth had a gift - she could turn simple ingredients into moments of joy.</p>
              <p>Baking wasn't just Ruth's profession; it was her way of connecting with people, uplifting spirits, and sharing her dreams. She always envisioned building something lasting, turning her love for baking into a legacy that would outlive her.</p>
              <p>Though Ruth passed away in July 2025, her spirit lives on in every recipe, every warm greeting, and every moment of joy our baked goods bring to families. Baked by Ruth is more than a bakery - it's the fulfillment of her dream.</p>

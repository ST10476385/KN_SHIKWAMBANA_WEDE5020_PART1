## Project Overview
**Baked by Ruth** is a tribute website honoring my late grandmother Ruth, who inspired this project through her love for baking and community.  
Baked by Ruth is a tribute website for a beloved community baker, designed to showcase traditional South African baked goods, promote community events, and empower youth through baking courses. The site is fully responsive, SEO-optimized, and features a modern, accessible design. It is built using semantic HTML5 and modular CSS3, with a strong focus on best practices, maintainability, and accessibility. All JavaScript was removed for Part 2 to meet assignment requirements, and all styling is handled through a single, well-organized `styles.css` file. The project demonstrates:
- Complete separation of structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS)
- Section-by-section CSS refactor for maintainability
- Accessibility and color contrast improvements
- Responsive layouts for all devices
- Detailed documentation and code comments for grading and future updates

---


## Website Goals and Objectives
- Share Ruth’s story and legacy with the community through engaging content and imagery
- Promote and sell traditional baked goods with clear product listings and pricing
- Advertise and manage community events and baking courses, including event registration and course details
- Enable users to make product, event, volunteer, and sponsorship enquiries via accessible forms
- Support youth development and entrepreneurship by highlighting community impact and opportunities
- Provide a seamless, accessible, and engaging user experience on all devices, with a focus on color contrast, keyboard navigation, and alt text

New semantic CSS classes were created for all sections, cards, buttons, grids, forms, and utility styles. This ensures maintainability and separation of concerns.

		- Newsletter signup, contact form, and all forms styled via CSS only.
		- Event sections (Upcoming Events, Categories, Past Events, Get Involved) refactored to use grid/flex layouts and new classes.
	- **Accessibility improvements:** Ensured all interactive elements have clear focus states, color contrast meets WCAG standards, and all images have descriptive alt text. Navigation is fully keyboard accessible.

		- Created a dedicated `cart.html` page with a styled cart table and navigation.
		- Improved `checkout.html` with a back button and consistent styling.
		- Cart icon in navigation now links to the cart page.
	- **Explanatory comments:** Added detailed HTML comments to all major sections in each HTML file to clarify structure and purpose for future maintainers and graders.
	- **Documentation updates:** Updated this README and website-checklist.md to reflect all changes, best practices, and assignment requirements.
	- **Linting and validation:** Fixed all CSS and HTML lint errors, including removing empty rulesets and ensuring all files pass validation.
